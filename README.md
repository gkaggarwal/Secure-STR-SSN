# Secure-STR-SSN

## ðŸ”’ Overview

The project implements a security enhancement for the Streaming Scan Network (SSN) architecture using a novel Secure Test Register (STR)-based user authorization mechanism.

### âœ¨ Key Features

- STR-based scan access control mechanism
- On-chip MISR-based key generation
- Binary authorization model to mitigate side-channel leakage
- Minimal hardware overhead for secure integration
